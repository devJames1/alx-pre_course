# Using Git and Github
I am familirizing myself with Git and Github. Tracking file changes, adding or staging file changes, committing and pushing to remote repository.
Also advanced tasks like branching. I created a new branch "update_script" made changes to files on it pushed the changes to the branch "update_script".
Made changes also to files on the master branch.
Then lastly tried to merge bracnch "update_script" into Master branch.
